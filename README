the goal is to have an application which keeps a computer
in sync w/ a remote server's data.

think dropbox but for groups (and w/ less features)

to run:

python backup.py <local data path> <remote data path> <host> <username> <password>

this is a _prototype_ at this point. before i could recommend anyone risk their
data with it i'd like to see many more features:
  concurrent uploads / downloads
  locking (make sure multiple clients aren't stepping on each other)
  updating of changed data only (delta updates) instead of replacing whole file
  .. and much much more
